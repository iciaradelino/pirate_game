STORY:
You're a desperate buccaneer with no choice: the Galleon Gang threatens to 
kill your family if you don't bring them a fortune by dawn. Your only hope 
is to sneak aboard The Crimson Serpent, the wealthiest ship in the known sea. 
To succeed you'll have to move cautiously, solve its hidden puzzles, and steal 
the gold from its hold. Every step is dangerous, every lock a test of your skill. 
Fail, and you'll lose more than treasureâ€”you'll lose everything.

Good luck, pirate!
